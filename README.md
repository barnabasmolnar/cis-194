# cis194

This repo is an attempt at solving some of the homework exercises from https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/. This resource was first recommended to me by a friend, but I have also read several positive threads about it on the /r/haskell subreddit, as well as [this recommendation](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/functional-education/).

This project has been initialised by [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
